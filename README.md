The web should be a fun and friendly place. Our goal is to make a simple, elegant app that allows people to interact with one another in a unique way. Worderp is that app.

# Community Story-Building

Worderp is a word game in which multiple anonymous players create a story together. Each player has the option to enter words or phrases as possible candidates to become the next entry in the story. This process creates a list of possible entries.  The list then goes through a timed voting period where players simultaneously examine the list and indicate the ones that they like or do not like. The game is a modern adaptation of the classic pen and paper game in which stories are created collaboratively word by word.
